This notebook contains the steps taken to select and generate the data and cached results for the BIO-ML data. For that we start by reading the data and select a subset of the 4800 isolates with the following citeria:

- it is fully identified species, no novel or candidate species or metagenome sample
- it has at least 10 reads (250M bases)

```{r}
library(data.table)

runs <- fread("data/bioml_run_table.tsv")
valid <- runs[
  !grepl("sp\\.|BIOML|metagenome|\\[", Organism) &
  Bases > 250e6
]
valid
```

Awesome, now let's sample 200 samples from those.

```{r}
set.seed(42)
final <- valid[sample(1:.N, 1000)]
fwrite(final, "data/course_run_table.tsv", sep="\t")
fwrite(final[, .(Run)], "data/course_run_ids.txt", col.names = FALSE)

final[, table(Organism)]
```
